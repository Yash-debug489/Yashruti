     I met you in class nine,
     sitting next to me on a bench,
    while English unit test papers
     were being passed around—not knowing that moment
    would stay.
        
Time took us places,
        distance took our moments,
        but never the feeling.
        
There’s still so much
        we haven’t lived yet—
        quiet walks, quiet walks, eating gol-gappa together,
        hell yes, actually any good food,exploring cities
        ,random path's,galiya,shopping together,getting lost
        together ya fir ak movie.
        
And someday,
        when time is kinder to us,
        I want to do all of itwith you.

      <h2>Surrendered Heart Resting Until The Inevitable💓</h2>
      <p>7 Shruti {1dec,2025}</p>
    </summary>
    <div class="poem-content">
So I swear sometimes
How I sit with all this love in my hands
Rarely I know where to keep it.
Usually I try to pour it into my text
Those good mornings,
Including the good nights,

Soft in the little check-ins that carry
Hidden feeling more than they seem?
Regularly I hide it inside the reels I send you
Unfolding,
The things my heart has been saying nonstop.
In all the small sentences—

Simple “take care,”
Hushed “sweet dreams,”
Reaching in the quiet ways I try to hold you
Underneath it all, without actually holding you.
Then do I tuck it into the gifts,
Into the tiny things I choose

Simply because they reminded me of you?
Honestly because even after doing all this
Really all that I can—
Unendingly I’m still overflowing.
Truly I didn’t know love could spill this much
In someone who is scared

She might be overwhelmed if I pour it fully.
Had I known people could drown
Right inside emotions so beautiful 
Unwilling to stay inside.
Tell me—
If you’d like,

Show me how you want it.
Honestly, where should I keep all this love
Returning to you,
Unshaken, no matter how much I try
To hold it back?
It keeps choosing you, endlessly.

     Dear shrutii— someone who feels like a story my heart never wants to end. She’s not just my bestie; she’s that person who unknowingly makes ordinary moments feel warm, alive, and full of meaning. 
It’s hard to put into words how much I love her, but it starts with her childish smile — that innocent curve that can melt every worry in me. It’s the kind of smile that doesn’t just light up her face, but my entire day. There’s something so pure, so effortlessly beautiful about it, that it feels like my favorite view in the world.Though meraa only source of it is just her random vlogs, snaps nd occasionally photos.

And then there’s her voice — that soft, sweet, almost musical tone that turns even a random conversation into something I’d replay in my mind. When she talks in her childish voice, it’s beyond adorable; it’s comfort, joy, and peace all wrapped into one sound. My ears have never felt such pleasure — it’s like every word she says carries a rhythm my heart already knows by heart.
She has these random rude-talking phases, where her entire vocabulary shrinks to just four or five words. But even that has a charm of its own. It’s like her unique way of saying, “I’m still here, but I'll talk to u like shit.” And instead of being annoyed, I always end up smiling, because even her little moods feel like a part of her magic.


Then comes the way she talks about her day, especially her coaching stories, ya Bokaro ho ya lucknow. The way she describes every detail — the teachers, her friends, the tiniest things — makes me feel like I’m right there with her..i know ppl like swan, shubham, siya , mansi mandvii like i have met them myself [spelling ka mt bolna]. Her voice paints pictures, and her words hold emotions that pull me in every single time.

There’s a rhythm to how she speak, it's very hard to describe but that tone of speaking --. I love her for all who u r.
